## Anonymous Political Discussion

#### Overview

In the midst of today's political landscape, it can be very hard to have an oversight of society's overall view of important issues like Brexit, presidential elections and referendums.

The mainstream media and social media has made politics extremely murky and confusing. A solution to this would be a product that allows people to discuss their political views with true anonymity in a space made interly for political discussion. A product like this would allow for a fluid conversation between opposing sides to take place. Polls and data visualisations could be thrown in to give users an idea of what others are thinking. This kind of product could be highly useful in countries where the government doesn't reflect the views of its citizens eg Russia, Turkey. 

#### Pros

* Creates a place purely for political discussion away from twitter and facebook.
* Allows for the fluid circulation of fresh ideas and concepts between people instead of creating a divide.
* Gives an insight into societies viewpoints on political issues.

#### Cons
You need access to a device with internet access.
Fake accounts could be made to change the narrative, there would need to be precautious made eg send in Id blockchain
Some of the voters not may use it, this includes the 50+ demographic.

#### How might it be built

I would need to create a web app that can be wrapped into apps for both android and ios as I need the product to be available to as many people as possible. The web app would require an extensive backend and front end. For the first pass, a forum style website could be built. I will need to learn how to build this.

#### Who is it for

The app is for anyone with a political interest that is of 18+. I say 18+ loosely, as the elderly are a demographic that is a generation that is not entirely ingrained in technology, some of them use it and some of them don't.  So a more realistic audience for this may actually be 18 to 39. It may be that this app is better designed for political discussion between the young generation, say 18 to 30.

#### What is the Business Model

There isn't one, it would ideally be a non-profit for the greater good of society. if ads needed to be introduced they would need to have zero political affiliation or if there was political affiliation you would need to advertise both sides of the political spectrum.

## Hitchhiker - Cheaply traverse the globe.

#### Overview

A product that allows people to get from A to B or close-ish on the cheap. Drivers can post up journeys they are about to make and how many passengers they are able to take. The Driver is not able to decide how much to charge for the trip.  Instead, the passengers can send a proposed amount and the driver can choose to accept or decline the offer.

The driver is a loose term, they could be a plane pilot, a coach driver, a truck driver, a motorbike rider (possibly unsafe), a captain of a ship or just a plain old car driver.

#### Pros

* Cheaper travelling, commuting.
* Helps reduce emissions via carpooling
* Perfect for places with bad public transport.

#### Cons
* You may need a taxi license and different insurance depending on your country of origin.
* Could just take public transport
* Could be troublesome when borders are involved.
Has been done a couple of times but not well.

#### How might it be built

A native app would need to be created, it would be very complicated to build. It would require heavy backend development which is foreign to me. I would need to learn swift, how to build a database and integrate a maps system.

#### Who is it for

The product is aimed at users that are from ages 18 to 30, this is an active demographic of the population. It's for the young traveller that is up for an adventure as long as it's cheap.

#### What is the Business Model

Taking a fee of 10% for example per hitchhiker payment would ideally be the business model. Also, drivers could choose to pay more to advertise their seats.

## Live Posture and Form analyzer

#### Overview

Bad posture and form account for a huge amount of sports-related injuries every year. A product that could quickly evaluate whether or not your posture and form are good when conducting an exercise could be invaluable in preventing injuries for athletes.

I devise a mobile app that makes use of a phone's camera to lock onto all of your joints in order to evaluate if out are using the correct form when performing an exercise. An example of this would be a squat. The shoulders, hips and feet must all be aligned along the vertical axis to perform a safe squat and to avoid injury.

#### Pros

* Helps prevent Injuries.
* Provides althletes and coaches with an extra tool to monitor.
* Helps to improve posture.

#### Cons
* Some exercises have a very complicated form.
* It can be hard to track limbs on certain clothing.

#### How might it be built

It would need to be a native app as it need to utilize a phone camera. Yet again this would be a very complicated app to get working. I would need to learn some CC+ in order to get the limb tracking to work followed by building an app completely with swift.

#### Who is it for

The app is created for anyone with an interest in sports, the main target would be personal trainers and coaches so that they could evaluate athletes form and show them where they are going wrong.  

#### What is the Business Model

The app would be free however, the free version would only have a couple exercises you could track the form with. In order to unlock the full libaray, you would need to opt into a monthly subscription.
